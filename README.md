# FizzBuzz

A Javascript based solution of a well known FizzBuzz test.

Brief: For multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number For the multiples of five print “Buzz” For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

The result is a generator of numbers showing the multiples of 3, 5 and 15. Three different algorithms are used to generate the list, one of them allowing the user to set for how many numbers the list should be generated.
